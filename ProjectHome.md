A social network for music. Since there is a thriving social network market for Facebook and Twitter, there is no thriving social network for music, on the computer, or on mobile. That is why we need one. This will even help new artists get their music out to the world. Let users listen to new music. Also, have some fun with seeing how people react to your music. You can even chat, comment, favorite, like, and share. Please help me on this project.
